# Flaim App

**Idea behind the app**
- The idea behind the app was to allow users to hold each other accountable for various goals via the app prompting users to upload a picture of them accomplishing said goal
- Goals could be set for anyhthing (eg. Working out consistently, studying consistently etc.) and every goal would have last for a period of time set by the user
- Each goal could also contain a 'reward' chosen by the user that can be claimed if the goal has been met consistently throughout the goal period 
- This notification to upload a picture would be recieved everyday at the same time for all users in the same goal 
- These pictures can then be approved/disapproved by the person or people you started the goal with
- You could also view goal "progress" pics for friends that you add in the platform; Similar to a feed

**Example use cases**
- 2 people agreeing to work out everyday for the next month
- Parent wanting their kids to do chores consistenly for a week. Kids would be prompted to upload a picture of them doing the goal
- 2 students agreeing to study everyday for a month consistently. The students would then be prompted to upload a picture of them actually studying
